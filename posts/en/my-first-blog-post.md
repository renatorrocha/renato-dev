Hey dev or recruiter! I'm Renato Rocha — a fullstack developer and the official beta tester of my own ideas (and bugs, of course). Naturally curious, I love getting my hands dirty and learning by breaking things — reading the docs is always a last resort, right?

I came up with the idea of building this blog to share some (not-so-unique) experiences with anyone who stumbled upon it. If it works out, it becomes a tutorial. If it doesn't... well, it's still content.

Here you'll find a mix of what I'm building, the technologies I'm testing, and maybe a few rants about code, software architecture, and coffee.
